    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>This virtual museum explores the legal, political, and cultural dimensions of how East and West Germany confronted the legacy of Nazi crimes through the courts.The division of Germany following World War II created two ideologically opposed states: the socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR), under Soviet influence, and the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), closely aligned with Western democracies. The ideological competition between these two states became a focal point of the Cold War, impacting nearly every aspect of their political, social, and judicial systems . Within this contentious environment, the prosecution of Nazi war criminals emerged as a unique battleground for ideological validation and propaganda.</p>
    <p>West Germany(FRG)’s judicial approach, shaped by American strategic interests, emphasized procedural fairness while limiting systemic accountability. In contrast, East Germany (GDR)’s Soviet-influenced judicial processes promoted ideological narratives of antifascism and socialist legitimacy. Ultimately, this comparative analysis underscores the ways in which ideological conflicts continued beneath the apparent calm of détente, profoundly influencing the pursuit of justice, collective memory, and national identities. By employing a comparative historical approach, this study specifically analyzes the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial (1963–1965) in West Germany and the Horst Fischer Trial (1966) in East Germany, highlighting how both trials were influenced by and reflective of the ideological rivalry between the capitalist West and communist East.</p>
