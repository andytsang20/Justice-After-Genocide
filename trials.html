    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This page examines two significant trials from post-war Germany: the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial and the Horst Fischer Trial. These trials were selected because they clearly demonstrate how the prosecution of Nazi war criminals was influenced by Cold War politics, highlighting stark differences in legal frameworks, judicial procedures, and ideological approaches between West and East Germany.</p>

  <div class="trial">

    <p>The Horst Fischer Trial was held in East Germany, prosecuting Horst Fischer, an SS doctor accused of war crimes at Auschwitz. Fischer was sentenced to death and executed in 1967. This trial served as a political statement by the GDR, emphasizing its antifascist stance and distinguishing its judicial approach from West Germany.</p>

  <div class="comparison">
    <h3>Comparison of the Trials</h3>
    <p>The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial and the Horst Fischer Trial represent different approaches to prosecuting Nazi war criminals, influenced by Cold War dynamics. West Germany emphasized procedural legality and detailed evidentiary proceedings, aiming at broader public awareness and historical accountability. East Germany used the trial to project a political message emphasizing antifascist legitimacy and swift justice. These contrasting trials illustrate how judicial proceedings were influenced by ideological differences and geopolitical pressures of the Cold War era.</p>
